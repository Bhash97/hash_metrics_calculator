# hash_metrics_calculator
This repository contains two key files for implementing and analyzing a hash function selection process for a blockchain-based e-voting system:

1. modified_votes_dataset.csv: A dataset representing votes in the e-voting system.
A modified dataset containing records of votes cast in the e-voting system.
Voter`: Identifier for the voter.
Candidate`: The candidate voted for.
Timestamp`: Date and time when the vote was cast.

2. hash_metrics_calculator.ipynb: 
A Python-based Jupyter notebook designed to compute various performance metrics of hash functions, such as collision resistance, entropy, and computational efficiency.purpose To analyze and compare hash functions (e.g., SHA-256, MD5, etc.) and validate the optimal hash function for the e-voting system.

 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or Jupyter Notebook
